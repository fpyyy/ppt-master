## 1. Template Adherence Rules

### 1.0 Pre-generation Batch Read

**Hard rule**: Locked SVG template page files MUST NOT be read by the agent. Before the first SVG page, read only the locked template contract JSON and any chart SVGs this deck will adapt.

| Source list | Read path |
|---|---|
| Locked template contract from `spec_lock.md template.contract` | `<project_path>/templates/<template_id>/template_contract.json` |
| Every distinct chart name in `spec_lock.md page_charts` | `templates/charts/<chart_name>.svg` |
| Chart types in `design_spec.md §VII` not covered above | `templates/charts/<chart_name>.svg` |

**Forbidden — locked template SVG visibility**:
- `Read` / `cat` / `Get-Content` / batch-read of `<project_path>/templates/<template_id>/*.svg`
- Using embedded template images, icons, or decoration as prompt context
- Falling back to legacy page-type SVG reads when `template_contract.json` is missing

`spec_lock.md` is the only file re-read per page (§2.1).

If `spec_lock.md template.engine` is `locked_svg` but the contract file is missing, STOP and ask the user to rebuild the template with the SVG-only `create-template` workflow.

### 1.1 Locked SVG Template Consumption

Locked templates are filled by script, not by template inheritance in prompt context.

| Page condition | Executor action |
|---|---|
| Structural page mapping has a repeated placeholder count that differs from the actual item count | Treat the mapping as incompatible; generate the page as free design using §1.2 |
| `page_layouts` has `P<NN>: <stem>` and `template.engine = locked_svg` | Use `template_contract.json` to get the page placeholders and workspaces; generate fill JSON and workspace fragments; run `svg_template.py apply` |
| `page_layouts` exists but no entry for current page | Free design; write the full SVG directly |
| No template section | Free design |

For a locked template page:

1. Create `<project_path>/template_fill/P<NN>_<stem>.json`.
2. Fill `placeholders` with values for the page's declared `{{...}}` tokens.
3. For `content` pages only, generate an SVG fragment for the declared workspace, usually `<project_path>/template_fill/P<NN>_main.svg`.
4. For `title`, `toc`, `chapter`, and `ending`, leave `workspaces` empty; replace placeholders only.
5. Add `workspaces: {"main": "P<NN>_main.svg"}` to the fill JSON only when the page role is `content`.
6. Run:

```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_template.py apply <project_path>/templates/<template_id> <stem> --data <project_path>/template_fill/P<NN>_<stem>.json -o <project_path>/svg_output/<NN>_<page_name>.svg
```

**Workspace fragment rule**: the fragment root uses `viewBox="0 0 <width> <height>"` where width/height match the workspace bbox in `template_contract.json`. The fragment coordinate system starts at the workspace top-left `(0,0)`.

**Placeholder fit rule**: For non-content locked pages, obey
`template_contract.json pages[].placeholders[].text_fit`. Keep replacement text
within `max_cjk_chars` / `max_latin_chars`; if `svg_template.py apply` reports
a fit error, shorten the wording and rerun. Do not lower font size or add new
workspace fragments to make long text fit.

### 1.2 Structural Page Replanning

**Mandatory**: For TOC / agenda pages and other non-content pages with repeated
indexed placeholders, compare template slot count with the actual item count
from the current page brief in `design_spec.md` §IX before running
`svg_template.py apply`.

| Check | Action |
|---|---|
| Counts match | Use the locked template page normally |
| Counts differ | Generate a full free-design SVG page; do not call `svg_template.py apply` for that page |
| `page_layouts` has no entry for the page | Generate a full free-design SVG page |

**Hard rule**: Do not fill unused template slots with blanks, duplicate an item,
invent an extra section, or shrink text to force too many items into the locked
slots.

**Replanned TOC layout directions**:

| Actual items | Layout |
|---|---|
| 2 | Two balanced columns or two strong horizontal bands |
| 3 | Three-column row, vertical stack, or triangular/radial composition |
| 4 | 2x2 grid or four-step vertical list with equal visual weight |
| 6+ | Two-column agenda or grouped chapter clusters |

Use `spec_lock.md colors` and `typography` for the replanned page. Keep the page
structural and calm: safe margins, consistent numbering, even spacing, and no
decorative element that implies a missing or hidden section.

### Page-Template Mapping Declaration (Required Output)

Before generating each page, output which contract page is used:

```
📝 **Template mapping**: locked_svg `<template_id>/<stem>` (or "None (free design)")
🎯 **Adherence rules / layout strategy**: [placeholder fill + workspace fragment / free design]
```

- **Locked content pages**: only generate the declared workspace fragment
- **Locked non-content pages**: replace `{{...}}` text only and respect text-fit budgets
- **Replanned structural pages**: generate entirely per the Design Spec and §1.2
- **No template**: generate entirely per the Design Spec

---

## 2. Design Parameter Confirmation (Mandatory Step)

Before the first SVG page, output a confirmation listing: canvas dimensions, body font size, color scheme (primary/secondary/accent HEX), font plan. Prevents spec/execution drift.

### 2.1 Per-page spec_lock re-read (Mandatory)

> Long decks drift off the declared palette/icons mid-deck due to context compression. `spec_lock.md` is the canonical execution reference — re-read it per page to bypass model memory.

**Hard rule**: Before generating **each** SVG page, `read_file <project_path>/spec_lock.md`. Use only values from this file, not from memory. If context was auto-compacted, also `read_file <project_path>/design_spec.md` for the current page's §IX brief.

**If `spec_lock.md` is missing**: emit `warning: spec_lock.md missing — generating without execution lock` once, then proceed using `design_spec.md` values. Expected only for legacy projects; new projects MUST have it (see [strategist.md](strategist.md) §6 step 4).

**Forbidden — values outside the lock**:

- Colors (fill / stroke / stop-color) MUST come from `colors`
- Icons MUST come from `icons.inventory`; library MUST equal `icons.library`
- Font family from `typography`: use role override (`title_family` / `body_family` / `emphasis_family` / `code_family`) if declared, else fall back to `font_family`
- Font sizes follow a **ramp anchored on `typography.body`**, not a closed menu. Use the declared slots when they fit. Intermediate sizes (e.g., 40px hero number, 13px annotation) are allowed if the ratio to `body` falls within the role's band (see `design_spec.md §IV ramp table`). Sizes outside every band require extending the lock first.
- Images MUST reference files listed under `images`; no invented filenames

If a page needs a value not in `spec_lock.md`, surface it — do not silently invent one.

**Per-page layout rhythm — `page_rhythm` section**:

Before drawing each page, look up its entry in `page_rhythm` (key format `P<NN>` matching the page index in §IX of `design_spec.md`) and apply the corresponding layout discipline:

| Tag | Layout discipline |
|-----|-------------------|
| `anchor` | Structural page (title / chapter / TOC / ending). Follow the matching template verbatim when `page_layouts` maps the page; otherwise use a restrained free-design structural layout. |
| `dense` | Information-heavy. Card grids, multi-column layouts, KPI dashboards, tables, and charts are all permitted. This is the baseline behavior. |
| `breathing` | Low-density impact page. Avoid **multi-card grid layouts** — do not organize content as multiple parallel rounded containers (3-card row, 4-card KPI grid, 2×2 matrix rendered as cards). Use naked text blocks, dividers, whitespace, or full-bleed imagery as the content structure. Single rounded visual elements (hero image corners, callouts, tags, one emphasis block) are fine — the rule is about grid structure, not about the `rx` attribute. Proportions follow information weight (not a preset ratio). Typical forms: hero quote, single large number with one-line interpretation, full-bleed image with floating caption, section transition. |

> Without rhythm variation, every page defaults to card grids (the "AI-generated" look). `page_rhythm` is the only narrative lever that survives context compression.

**Missing `page_rhythm` section** → emit `warning: spec_lock.md missing page_rhythm — defaulting all pages to dense` once, fall back to `dense` for all pages.

**Tag not found for current page** → fall back to `dense` silently. Do not invent a tag.

**Per-page template lookup — `page_layouts` section**:

Before drawing each page, look up its entry in `page_layouts` to decide which locked template page stem applies. Template SVGs were not loaded; only the contract was loaded in §1.0.

- Entry present (e.g., `P04: content`) → the stem MUST appear in `template_contract.json pages[].stem`; generate fill JSON and run `svg_template.py apply`. Generate a workspace fragment only when that contract page has a `content` role and a declared workspace.
- No entry for this page → free design. **Not an error** — Strategist intentionally left this page free.
- Whole section absent → no layout template pages are used.

Do **not** invent a layout entry, and do **not** assume a template just because `templates/` exists — if `page_layouts` is present but silent for this page, that silence is the instruction.

**Per-page chart reference — `page_charts` section**:

Before drawing each page, look up its entry in `page_charts` to decide which chart structure applies (the SVG itself was loaded in §1.0):

- Entry present (e.g., `P09: timeline_horizontal`) → adapt the corresponding chart SVG already in context. Apply project colors/typography/density; do not copy verbatim. Cross-reference `templates/charts/charts_index.json` for the chart's purpose summary if needed.
- No entry for this page → either no chart on this page, or a chart that didn't match any catalog template (Strategist's `no-template-match` fallback). Design the visualization from scratch using `design_spec.md §VII` for guidance.
- Whole section absent → no chart pages in this deck.

---

## 3. Execution Guidelines

- **Proximity**: group related elements with tight spacing; separate unrelated groups
- **Spec adherence**: follow color, layout, canvas format, and typography in the spec
- **Template structure**: locked templates are applied through `svg_template.py apply`; never read template SVG source
- **Main-agent ownership**: SVG generation must run in the main agent (not sub-agents) — pages share upstream context for cross-page visual continuity
- **Generation rhythm**: lock global design context first, then generate pages sequentially in one continuous context. No batched groups (e.g., 5 at a time).
- **Phased batch generation** (recommended):
  1. **Visual Construction Phase**: generate all SVG pages sequentially for visual consistency. Use layout judgment for chart marks during the draft. **MUST embed plot-area markers** per §3.1 below on every chart page — coordinate calibration is a post-generation step (see [`workflows/verify-charts.md`](../workflows/verify-charts.md)) that depends on these markers.
  2. **Quality Check Gate**: run `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/svg_quality_checker.py <project_path>` on `svg_output/`. Any `error` (banned features, viewBox mismatch, spec_lock drift, non-PPT-safe font, etc.) MUST be fixed on the offending page before proceeding — regenerate and re-check. Address `warning`s when straightforward. Do NOT defer to after `finalize_svg.py` — finalize rewrites SVG and masks some violations.
  3. **Logic Construction Phase**: after SVGs pass the quality check, batch-generate speaker notes for narrative continuity.

### 3.1 Chart Plot-Area Marker (MANDATORY on every chart page)

> The [`verify-charts`](../workflows/verify-charts.md) workflow enumerates chart pages from `design_spec.md §VII`, then reads each page's plot-area marker to feed `svg_position_calculator.py`. Missing marker → verify-charts has to re-derive the plot area from axis lines, paying the cost on every run.

Every SVG page that contains a data visualization chart MUST include a plot-area marker inside `<g id="chartArea">`, placed **after axis lines** and **before the first data element** (bar, line, area, point).

**Rectangular plot area** (bar / horizontal_bar / grouped_bar / stacked_bar / line / area / stacked_area / scatter / waterfall / pareto / butterfly):

```xml
<!-- chart-plot-area: x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max -->
```

**Radial charts** (pie / donut / radar):

```xml
<!-- chart-plot-area: pie | center: cx,cy | radius: r -->
<!-- chart-plot-area: donut | center: cx,cy | outer-radius: r1 | inner-radius: r2 -->
<!-- chart-plot-area: radar | center: cx,cy | radius: r -->
```

**How to determine coordinate values**:

| Value | Derivation |
|-------|------------|
| `x_min` | X coordinate of the Y-axis line (leftmost data boundary) |
| `y_min` | Y coordinate of the topmost grid line (highest data boundary) |
| `x_max` | X coordinate of the rightmost axis endpoint or grid line |
| `y_max` | Y coordinate of the X-axis baseline |
| `cx, cy` | Center point of pie/donut/radar (accounting for `transform="translate()"`) |
| `r` | Outer radius of the chart |

**Per-page verification** — after writing each chart SVG, confirm the marker exists:

```bash
grep "chart-plot-area" <project_path>/svg_output/<current_page>.svg
```

> All chart templates in `templates/charts/` include this marker as a reference. If you are drawing a chart and the marker is absent, you have a bug.
- **Technical specs**: see [shared-standards.md](shared-standards.md) for SVG/PPT constraints
- **Card containers — use the documented patterns**: when a content page needs section cards (4 quadrants, parallel aspects, capability blocks, info cards), use the patterns codified in [`templates/charts/CHART_STYLE_GUIDE.md`](../templates/charts/CHART_STYLE_GUIDE.md) §11 — half-rounded section tab (§11.1), nested card border without stroke (§11.2), card-grid skeletons (§11.3), diagonal dashed connector for cross-quadrant relationships (§11.5), ground-anchor ellipse as a non-filter depth marker (§11.6), bidirectional interaction arrows for paired protocols (§11.7). Do not reinvent the "tinted full-rounded rect + white cover-rect to hide the bottom corners" hack; it survives in older templates but breaks SVG→PPTX color editing. Reference templates: [`labeled_card.svg`](../templates/charts/labeled_card.svg), [`swot_analysis.svg`](../templates/charts/swot_analysis.svg), [`kpi_cards.svg`](../templates/charts/kpi_cards.svg), [`matrix_2x2.svg`](../templates/charts/matrix_2x2.svg), [`team_roster.svg`](../templates/charts/team_roster.svg), [`client_server_flow.svg`](../templates/charts/client_server_flow.svg).
- **Semantic shapes over preset stacks**: when a slide needs to express "ascending / converging / breaking through / stacking" — i.e., a relationship that goes beyond a generic arrow — prefer a single custom `<polygon>` or `<path>` that encodes the semantics geometrically, rather than stacking multiple preset arrows. A converging-tip path or a podium polygon reads faster than three arrows pointing at a label. Do not codify these as templates — they are page-specific; the rule is just "consider polygon before stacking presets."
- **Visual depth — through restraint**: layered depth comes from rhythm (flat vs lifted, dense vs spacious), not from shadows everywhere. Apply shadow to at most 2-3 genuinely floating elements per page (cards on photos, primary CTA, overlays); keep peer-grid cards, dividers, body containers flat. Reach for typography weight, spacing, accent bars, subtle tints **before** shadow. Full rules in shared-standards.md §6.

### SVG File Naming Convention

Format: `<NN>_<page_name>.svg` (two-digit number from 01; name matches the deck's language and the page title in the Design Spec).

Examples: `01_封面.svg` / `02_目录.svg` / `03_核心优势.svg`; `01_cover.svg` / `02_agenda.svg` / `03_key_benefits.svg`.

## 4. Icon Usage

Strategist chooses the library and inventory; Executor only implements. Library details and one-library rule: [`../templates/icons/README.md`](../templates/icons/README.md). This section defines placeholder syntax.

**Built-in icons — Placeholder method (recommended)**:

```xml
<!-- chunk-filled (straight-line geometry, sharp corners, structured) -->
<use data-icon="chunk-filled/home" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587"/>

<!-- tabler-filled (bezier-curve forms, smooth & rounded contours) -->
<use data-icon="tabler-filled/home" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587"/>

<!-- tabler-outline (light, line-art style — screen-only decks) -->
<use data-icon="tabler-outline/home" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587"/>

<!-- phosphor-duotone (single color + 20% backplate — soft depth without solid weight) -->
<use data-icon="phosphor-duotone/house" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587"/>

<!-- simple-icons (brand logos — used alongside the deck's primary library, only for real company/product marks) -->
<use data-icon="simple-icons/github" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#181717"/>

<!-- tabler-outline with thin / bold stroke (stroke-style libraries only) -->
<use data-icon="tabler-outline/home" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587" stroke-width="1.5"/>
<use data-icon="tabler-outline/home" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587" stroke-width="3"/>
```

> ⚠️ **Color**: ALWAYS use `fill="#HEX"` on `<use data-icon="...">`. NEVER use `stroke` or `fill="none"`, even for stroke-style libraries.
>
> **stroke-width** (stroke-style libraries only, currently `tabler-outline`): allowed values `{1.5, 2, 3}`. If `spec_lock.md icons.stroke_width` is declared, all placeholders MUST use that value deck-wide. Default `2` if absent (legacy). Ignored on non-stroke libraries.
>
> Icons are auto-embedded by `finalize_svg.py` — no need to run `embed_icons.py` manually.

**Searching for icons** — use terminal, zero token cost:
```bash
ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/chunk-filled/ | grep home
ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/tabler-filled/ | grep home
ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/tabler-outline/ | grep chart
ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/phosphor-duotone/ | grep house
ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/simple-icons/ | grep github
```

**Abstract concept → icon name** (names for `chunk-filled`; tabler libraries use their own equivalents — verify with `ls | grep`):

| Concept | chunk-filled | tabler-filled / tabler-outline |
|---------|-------|-------------------------------|
| Growth / Increase | `arrow-trend-up` | same |
| Decline / Decrease | `arrow-trend-down` | same |
| Success / Complete | `circle-checkmark` | `circle-check` |
| Warning / Risk | `triangle-exclamation` | `alert-triangle` |
| Innovation / Idea | `lightbulb` | `bulb` |
| Strategy / Goal | `target` | same |
| Efficiency / Speed | `bolt` | same |
| Collaboration / Team | `users` | same |
| Settings / Config | `cog` | `settings` |
| Security / Trust | `shield` | same |
| Money / Finance | `dollar` | `currency-dollar` |
| Time / Deadline | `clock` | same |
| Location / Region | `map-pin` | same |
| Communication | `comment` | `message` |
| Analysis / Data | `chart-bar` | same |
| Process / Flow | `arrows-rotate-clockwise` | `refresh` |
| Global / World | `globe` | `world` |
| Excellence / Award | `star` | same |
| Expand / Scale | `maximize` | same |
| Problem / Issue | `bug` | same |

> For self-evident names (home, user, file, search, arrow, etc.) — just `grep chunk-filled/` directly without consulting the table.

> ⚠️ **Icon validation**: only use icons from the Design Spec's approved inventory. Verify each via `ls | grep` before use. Mixing libraries within one deck is FORBIDDEN.

---

## 5. Visualization Reference

Chart SVGs referenced in **VII. Visualization Reference List** are loaded once via the §1.0 batch read. This section governs adaptation only.

**Hard rule**: adapt the loaded chart SVG; do not improvise from memory and do not replicate verbatim. Apply project colors, typography, content; preserve visualization type.

**Adaptation rules**:
- **Preserve**: visualization type (bar/line/pie/timeline/process/framework…) as specified
- **Adapt**: data, labels, colors (project scheme), dimensions
- **Freely adjust**: composition, axis ranges, grid, legend, spacing, decoration — as long as the chart stays accurate and readable
- **Forbidden**: changing visualization type without spec justification; omitting data points or structural elements from the outline

> Templates: `templates/charts/` (70 types). Index: `templates/charts/charts_index.json`

### 5.1 Chart Coordinate Calibration

Coordinate calibration runs as a **standalone post-generation workflow**, not inside the executor pipeline. After SVG generation completes, if the deck contains data charts, run [`workflows/verify-charts.md`](../workflows/verify-charts.md) before post-processing.

The executor's only obligation here is upstream: embed the `<!-- chart-plot-area ... -->` marker on every chart page during initial draft (§3.1). Verify-charts enumerates chart pages from `design_spec.md §VII` (authoritative deck plan) and uses the marker to feed `svg_position_calculator.py`.

> Do NOT run `svg_position_calculator.py` during the initial draft. The calculator calibrates already-generated SVGs against their declared plot areas; running it before the SVG exists has nothing to compare against.

---

## 6. Image Handling

Handle images by their status in the Design Spec's Image Resource List. Status enum and lifecycle: [`svg-image-embedding.md`](svg-image-embedding.md).

| Status | Source | Handling |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Existing** | User-provided | Reference images directly from `../images/` directory |
| **Generated** | Generated by Image_Generator | Reference images directly from `../images/` directory |
| **Sourced** | Web-acquired by Image_Searcher | Reference from `../images/`. **Read [`image_sources.json`](image-searcher.md) to decide attribution** — see §6.1 below. |
| **Needs-Manual** | Acquisition failed and file is absent | Use dashed border placeholder unless the expected file exists |
| **Placeholder** | Not yet prepared | Use dashed border placeholder |

**Reference syntax**: see [`svg-image-embedding.md`](svg-image-embedding.md).

**Placeholder**: Dashed border `<rect stroke-dasharray="8,4" .../>` + description text

**`no-crop` images**: when a `spec_lock.md images` entry ends with ` | no-crop`, size the container to the image's native ratio (from `analyze_images.py` or file dims) and use `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"`. Untagged entries are croppable — default to `slice`.

**Hard rule - no generated-base text overlays**: Do not build hybrid slides where Image_Generator provides a blank / unlabeled framework image and Executor fills it with SVG or PPT text. If an image row is `Generated`, treat the image pixels as final visual content.

| Overlay type | Action |
|---|---|
| Slide title, page header, caption, source attribution, section chrome outside the image | Allowed |
| Gradient / opacity overlay for legibility on hero or atmosphere backgrounds | Allowed |
| Node labels, step names, framework headings, legend entries, arrow labels, callouts that belong inside a generated diagram | Forbidden |

**Generated diagram handling**: For `Type: Diagram` images, place the image as a complete labeled asset using normal image rules. If the slide requires editable diagram text, regenerate the page as native SVG shapes instead of using the generated image; do not combine a generated diagram base with manual text fill.

### 6.1 Inline Attribution for Sourced Images (web path)

Whenever the slide uses an image with `Status: Sourced`, look up the corresponding entry in `project/images/image_sources.json` and act on `license_tier`:

| `license_tier` | Action on this slide |
|---|---|
| `no-attribution` | Embed the `<image>` element only. **No credit element needed.** |
| `attribution-required` | Embed the `<image>` element **plus** a small inline `<text>` credit element per the visual spec in [image-searcher.md §7](./image-searcher.md). |

The credit text is **not** rendered by post-processing or export — it must be present in the SVG you produce. The shape of the credit element (size, position, color, multi-image source line, hero gradient overlay) is specified in [image-searcher.md §7](./image-searcher.md). Do not invent a different style.

Use `attribution_text` from the manifest entry as the **starting point**, then compress for the small-text constraint (drop URL, drop filename, keep "via Provider / License"). For CC0/PD images that landed in the `attribution-required` tier only because of upstream metadata quirks (rare), credits are still safe to render.

`svg_quality_checker.py` treats missing CC BY / CC BY-SA inline attribution as an **error**. Fix the offending SVG before post-processing.

**The manifest is the single source of truth for credits.** Do not duplicate license info into speaker notes or any other artifact.

---

## 7. Font Usage

Source of truth: `spec_lock.md typography`. Use `font_family` as default; override per role with `title_family` / `body_family` / `emphasis_family` / `code_family` if declared.

If `spec_lock.md` is absent, consult [`strategist.md`](strategist.md) §g — do not invent a stack.

**Hard rule**: every SVG `font-family` stack MUST end with a pre-installed family (Microsoft YaHei / SimHei / SimSun / Arial / Calibri / Segoe UI / Times New Roman / Georgia / Consolas / Courier New / Impact / Arial Black). PPTX has no runtime fallback — missing fonts degrade to Calibri.

---

## 8. Speaker Notes Generation Framework

### Task 1. Generate Complete Speaker Notes Document

After all SVG pages are finalized, enter Logic Construction Phase and write the full notes to `notes/total.md`. Batch-writing (not per-page) lets transitions plan coherently.

**Pure spoken narration**: notes are read aloud verbatim by `notes_to_audio.py` (TTS). Write only what should be spoken. No visible markers, no labeled meta-lines, no enumerated key-point lists, no duration annotations — anything you write outside the heading will be vocalized.

**Per-page structure**: `# <number>_<page_title>` heading (the `#` heading line is the only thing stripped before TTS), pages separated by `---`. Body is 2–5 natural sentences carrying the page's core message. Page-to-page transitions live inside the opening sentence as natural prose ("接下来……" / "Having framed X, let's turn to Y") — no bracketed `[过渡]` / `[Transition]` tags.

**Concrete examples** — same shape applies to any language; just write naturally in that language.

中文 deck：

```
# 02_市场格局

在明确了行业背景之后，我们来看具体的市场格局。当前线上零售集中度持续上升，前三大平台合计份额已经达到百分之六十八，腰部玩家正在被快速挤压，留给新进入者的窗口期不超过十八个月。这意味着我们的策略必须聚焦，而不是铺开。
```

英文 deck：

```
# 02_market_landscape

Having framed the industry backdrop, let's look at the actual market landscape. Online retail concentration keeps rising — the top three platforms now hold sixty-eight percent of combined share, mid-tier players are being squeezed fast, and the window for new entrants is under eighteen months. This means our strategy has to focus, not spread.
```

> 日本語 / 한국어 / 其他语言：照搬同样的结构，用对应语言自然书写即可。

**Number readability**: TTS reads digits and symbols literally. Prefer fully-spelled forms in the language being spoken when literal pronunciation would be awkward (e.g. Chinese "百分之六十八" reads better than "68%"; "1-2分钟" reads as "一减二分钟"). Plain integers and percentages in English are fine as-is.

**Common mistakes to avoid**:
- Leaving any bracketed stage marker (`[过渡]` / `[Transition]` / `[Pause]` / `[Data]` / `[Scan Room]` / `[Interactive]` / `[Benchmark]` etc.) in the text — they will be read aloud literally.
- Adding `要点：① …` / `Key points: (1) …` / `时长：2分钟` / `Duration: 2 minutes` / `Flex: …` lines — TTS will speak "要点 一 …".
- Mixing languages within one deck's notes.

### Task 2. Split Into Per-Page Note Files

Auto-split `notes/total.md` into per-page files in `notes/`.

**Naming**: match SVG names (`01_cover.svg` → `notes/01_cover.md`); `slide01.md` also supported (legacy).

---

## 9. Next Steps After Completion

> **Auto-continuation**: After Visual Construction Phase (all SVG pages) and Logic Construction Phase (all notes) are complete, the Executor proceeds directly to the post-processing pipeline.

**Post-processing & Export** (same canonical pipeline as [shared-standards.md §5](shared-standards.md)):

```bash
# 1. Split speaker notes
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/total_md_split.py <project_path>

# 2. SVG post-processing (auto-embed icons, images, etc.)
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/finalize_svg.py <project_path>

# 3. Export PPTX
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path>
# Output:
#   exports/<project_name>_<timestamp>.pptx           ← main native pptx
#   backup/<timestamp>/<project_name>_svg.pptx        ← SVG snapshot
#   backup/<timestamp>/svg_output/                    ← Executor SVG source backup
```
